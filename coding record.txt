0906 - wanting
1. landmark process may be not required
2. action_abstract: we need to change the action output from the agent,
   maybe we could rewrite the model.learn func
   if the algorithm is discrete we just change it into[0,1,-1];
   elif the algorithm is continuous we may add a softmax func, but it is better not to change the algo
   may be we can try DDQN first.
3. actions_signal:
4. I think the regret is a percentage instead of the time series,
    but your code inspire me that
    we could draw the (best_asset, agent_asset, baseline) into one plot for comparison
5. best_action:  the landmark action
   if signal = "^":
        sell(Whole warehouse)
   elif signal = "v":
        buy(Whole warehouse)
6.train and test 80/20, and also debug
  split_point = int(len(df)*0.8)
